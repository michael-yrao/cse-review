    /*
    * This problem seems quite annoying
    * First thing we need to do is think of all the unique words that can be formed
    * given that 0 <= num <= 2^31 - 1
    *   1. Increments of 1 up until 20: "One", "Two", etc.
    *   2. Increments of 10 up until 90: "Ten", "Twenty", "Thirty", etc.
    *   3. Hundred and Multiples of 1000: "Hundred", "Thousand", "Million", "Billion"
    *   5. There is also Zero, but that is only used for one single case so we can maybe use that as base case
