        So given that we know the entire grid is surrounded by water
        What we want to do effectively is just find the first 1 that we traverse through
        and count every 1 that is connected to it as 1 island. We can do this by either BFS or DFS, I will do DFS here
        Once that is completed, we can just repeat the process.

        Normally we would want to tag which vertex we have already visited, but since we don't care about 0s
        What we should do is just mark the visited vertices as 0
