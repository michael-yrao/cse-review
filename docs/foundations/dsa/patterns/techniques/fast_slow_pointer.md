# Fast & Slow Pointer Patterns

Two pointers moving at **different speeds** through a sequence (usually a linked list). The speed gap is what detects cycles, finds the middle, and locates positions relative to the end — all in one pass, O(1) space.

## When to reach for it (recognition signal)

- "does this linked list have a cycle?"
- "find the middle of the list"
- "find where the cycle begins"
- "find the duplicate number" in an array of `1..n` (it's a cycle in disguise)
- palindrome linked list (find middle, reverse half)

## Template — the two-speed walk

```python
slow = fast = head
while fast and fast.next:      # guard BOTH: fast.next.next needs both non-null
    slow = slow.next           # 1 step
    fast = fast.next.next      # 2 steps
    # if cycle: they will eventually meet (fast == slow)
# if no cycle: fast falls off the end; slow is at the MIDDLE
```

Two facts fall out of the same loop:
- **Cycle** → fast laps slow and they collide. No cycle → fast reaches null.
- **Middle** → when fast hits the end (finite list), slow has gone exactly half as far.

## Finding the cycle's start (Floyd, phase 2)

After slow and fast meet inside the cycle, reset one pointer to head and advance **both one step at a time** — they meet at the cycle entrance (a distance identity makes this exact):

```python
slow2 = head
while slow2 != slow:
    slow2 = slow2.next
    slow = slow.next
return slow                    # entrance of the cycle
```

**287. Find the Duplicate** is this exact trick on an array: treat `i -> nums[i]` as "next," the duplicate forces a cycle, and phase 2 finds its entrance.

## Practice

| Problem | NC150? | Wrinkle |
|---|---|---|
| 141. Linked List Cycle | ✅ | Bare cycle detection (done) |
| 142. Linked List Cycle II | No | + find the cycle start (phase 2) |
| 876. Middle of the Linked List | No | Slow = middle when fast ends |
| 287. Find the Duplicate Number | ✅ | Array-as-linked-list cycle |
| 234. Palindrome Linked List | No | Find middle, reverse second half, compare |

## Common pitfalls

- **Loop guard** — `while fast and fast.next` is mandatory; `fast = fast.next.next` dereferences two levels. (This is the exact 141 sticking point.)
- **Even vs odd length** — where `slow` lands as "middle" differs by one; decide if you want the first or second middle and adjust the guard (`while fast.next and fast.next.next` gives the first middle).
- **Comparing nodes, not values** — cycle detection compares node identity (`fast is slow`), not `.val`.
