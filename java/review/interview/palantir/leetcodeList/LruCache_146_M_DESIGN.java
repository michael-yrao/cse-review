    * Difficulty of this problem comes in what it means when Least Recently Used
    * We need to keep track of how many times the values get used, both put and get counts as usages
    *
    *   1. Have a HashMap for O(1) access to the values
    *   2. Use a Doubly-Linked List so we can keep track of the ordering of the usages
    *   3. As such, we would need two pointers here, the least recently used and most recently used nodes
